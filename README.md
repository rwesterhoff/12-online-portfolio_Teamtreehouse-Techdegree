# Project 12 - Online Portfolio

Build an online portfolio to showcase the work you've created as part of this program and any projects you've built on your own. Bring all of your talents with HTML, CSS and JavaScript together to create a fun and interactive online portfolio.

No files are supplied for this project: what it looks like and how it works is up to you. You can use a framework like Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation, or simply build the HTML and CSS from scratch.
