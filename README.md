# Project 12 - Online portfolio

I built an online portfolio to showcase the work I've created as part of this program and any projects I've built on my own. I brought all skills from HTML, SASS and JavaScript together to create a fun and interactive online portfolio.

No files are supplied for this project: what it looks like and how it works was up to myself. 

I designed the responsive pages with Sketch. I used a progressive enhancement approach. Basically it works and looks fine and does what it needs to do without JS, showing work on click of the links and buttons within the descriptions. To enhance the portfolio the responsive grid works with a 'js'-class on the body. As I move descriptions – that are hidden with this class – around in the DOM to fit the thumbnails. Other than that I used Typekit for the fonts and TweenLite from GSAP to add some scrolling on click of the 'View more' buttons. The workflow was covered by Gulp.

It's tested and works great on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Android devices. 
On iOS I stayed with the progressive enhancement method as a lot of stuff just didn't work nicelly, this might be covered in the future.
